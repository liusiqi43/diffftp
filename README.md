# diffftp
scripts to monitor/download new added files

# Installation
    git clone https://github.com/liusiqi43/diffftp.git

# Usage
rename settings_common.py to settings.py and config accordingly.

    python run.py

You will be asked if you want to download all the new files. 
Either way, latest files metadata will be stored and only new files will be downloaded 
when you run the script again in the future.
